simple soccer demo videos

The 4 demo.avi files show the 4 and 5 player versions of the implemented team competing against the team included with the simulation software.

vsbucklandteam-demo.avi shows the implemented team playing against the included team

vsbuckland-target-demo.avi shows the two teams playing with the target locations displayed as small red dots.  Note how the targets change when the player states change.

toolow-potential-demo.avi, toohigh-potential-demo.avi, low-potentital-demo.avi, high-potential-demo.avi, and base-potential-demo.avi show the different parameters that can be used and how they affect the path planning.

minimumproblem-pathfinding.avi and multipleobstacle-pathfinding.avi show some of the problems and features of the pathfinding system.

ballnoise-demo.avi, highballnoise.avi, ballnoise-outofboundsproblem.avi show how the pathfinding and state system works with simulated noise from the visual system.  The outofbounds problem video demonstrates a problem with the simulation when the ball noise pushes it out of bounds.

These 3 videos show some specific features of the pathfinding and state systems:

demo2.avi
4 player team versus the included 5 player team
04 pathfinding
0:12 defender moving to attacking
0:22 pass
0:50 pass from middle to scoring position
1:15 kicking inacuracy
1:55 to 2:05 note issues with tracking the balls current vs future location
2:55 pathfinding around 2 obstacles
3:20 bug in pathfinding causes the players to lock up

demo3.avi
5 player team vs the included 5 player team
0:18 problems tracking current vs future
note spacing between the two attackers caused by the pathfinding
1:35 pass from middle defender to attacker then middle defender moves back to defense

demo4.avi
1:45 note how the defenders move to chase the ball in sequence as they each become the closest player to the ball
2:49 note how the movement of the robot closest to blue team player #7 affects the path of the player farther away
3:37: pathfinding systen finding two different solutions for the players to move around the obstacle.
